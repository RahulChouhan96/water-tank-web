# Water Tank Problem (With UI)

I have solved this problem in `problem.js` file.


## How to run?

Install live-server extension in VS code and run it. It will open the app in the browser.


## How to use?

You will see a input text box and a button. Text box is to take input as list of numbers separated with comma.
Enter list of numbers such as: `0,4,2,0,0,6,0,6,4,0` and click the "Add Array" button.
Now, you will see a nice table showing the actual water tank problem. It will have both blocks and water showcased in different colors.
It also displays the actual maximum unit of water that can be trapped as a result.
